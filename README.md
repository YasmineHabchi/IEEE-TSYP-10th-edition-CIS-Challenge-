## Intrusion Detection Model for IEEE TSYP CIS Challenge

This notebook was developed for the **10th IEEE Tunisian Students and Young Professionals (TSYP) Congress**, organized by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) - Tunisia Section in December 2022.

### Task

To build a multi-class classification model for network intrusion detection on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

### Results

The models achieved **99.06% accuracy** with XGBoost and **99.44% accuracy** with CNNs.  
This submission, along with our presentation, secured us **first place** among 45 national submissions.
